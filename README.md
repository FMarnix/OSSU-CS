This is my repository of courses completed through the OSSU/CS guide to achieve my Computer Science degree certification.
In the curriculum section i'll be adding the certification of completion or the repository of achievements or exercises made in each course to validate them as a completed.

## Prerequisites

- [Core CS](#core-cs) assumes the student has already taken [high school math](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/blob/master/FAQ.md#how-can-i-review-the-math-prerequisites), including algebra, geometry, and pre-calculus.
- [Advanced CS](#advanced-cs) assumes the student has already taken the entirety of Core CS
and is knowledgeable enough now to decide which electives to take.
- Note that [Advanced systems](#advanced-systems) assumes the student has taken a basic physics course (e.g. AP Physics in high school).

## Intro CS

### Introduction to Programming

If you've never written a for-loop, or don't know what a string is in programming, start here. This course is self-paced, allowing you to adjust the number of hours you spend per week to meet your needs.

**Topics covered**:
`simple programs`
`simple data structures`

### Introduction to Computer Science

This course will introduce you to the world of computer science. Students who have been introduced to programming, either from the courses above or through study elsewhere, should take this course for a flavor of the material to come. If you finish the course wanting more, Computer Science is likely for you!

**Topics covered**:
`computation`
`imperative programming`
`basic data structures and algorithms`

## Final project

OSS University is project-focused.
The assignments and exams for each course are to prepare you to use your knowledge to solve real-world problems.

After you've gotten through all of Core CS and the parts of Advanced CS relevant to you, you should think about a problem that you can solve using the knowledge you've acquired.
Not only does real project work look great on a resume, but the project will also validate and consolidate your knowledge.
You can create something entirely new, or you can find an existing project that needs help via websites like
[CodeTriage](https://www.codetriage.com/)
or
[First Timers Only](http://www.firsttimersonly.com/).

Students who would like more guidance in creating a project may choose to use a series of project oriented courses. Here is a sample of options (many more are available, at this point you should be capable of identifying a series that is interesting and relevant to you):

# Computer Science - Great Courses

This is a list of high-quality courses that, for one reason or another, didn't make it into the curriculum.
The most common reasons are that the course isn't available often enough,
or that there was an alternative that fit better into the curriculum.
